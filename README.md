# Password Generator
This repository houses the files that implement an online password generator.

### Purpose

This website will generate a password, to the length specified by the user, using special characters, numbers, and lowercase and uppercase letters. It also provides a means for copying the newly generated password to the clipboard.

### Functionality

The user starts by pressing the 'Generate Password' button. The website then prompts the user to enter the length for the password -- at least 8 characters, but not more than 128 characters.

The website asks the user to confirm which categories of characters to use for the password: special characters, numbers, and lowercase and uppercase letters. If the user does not choose any of these categories, the website alerts them that they need to pick at least one.

Then, the website generates and displays the password. It enables the 'Copy to Clipboard' button, which allows the user to copy the new password to the clipboard for use elsewhere.

### New stuff that I used in this project
